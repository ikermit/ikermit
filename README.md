It's K3RM1T, I would be very happy to hop on any conversation about windows kernel and system programming. Also, I have been active on Github for a couple of years, This is my new account for my kernel-related contributions.

You can Email me in case of any questions. I also love Open Source and team collaboration in any possible way.
